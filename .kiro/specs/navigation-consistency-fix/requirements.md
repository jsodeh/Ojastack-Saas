# Navigation Consistency Fix

## Introduction

The navigation menu across public pages (Features, Pricing, Docs, Contact) shows inconsistent menu items for authenticated users. When logged in, users see a confusing mix of authenticated navigation (Dashboard, My Account) and unauthenticated navigation (Sign In, Get Started) depending on which page they're viewing. This creates a poor user experience and navigation confusion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Consistent Authentication-Aware Navigation

**User Story:** As an authenticated user browsing the website, I want to see consistent navigation menu items across all pages, so that I have a clear and predictable navigation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user visits any public page (Features, Pricing, Docs, Contact) THEN the navigation SHALL show "Dashboard" and "My Account" buttons
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user visits any public page THEN the navigation SHALL show "Sign In" and "Get Started" buttons
3. WHEN a user's authentication state changes THEN all navigation menus SHALL update consistently across all pages
4. WHEN an authenticated user clicks "My Account" THEN they SHALL be directed to their profile settings page

### Requirement 2: Navigation Button Functionality

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want the navigation buttons to take me to the appropriate authenticated sections of the application, so that I can efficiently access my account and dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user clicks "Dashboard" THEN they SHALL be redirected to `/dashboard`
2. WHEN an authenticated user clicks "My Account" THEN they SHALL be redirected to `/dashboard/settings/profile`
3. WHEN the "My Account" button is displayed THEN it SHALL include a user icon for visual clarity
4. WHEN navigation buttons are clicked THEN the routing SHALL work correctly without page refresh

### Requirement 3: Visual Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation styling to remain consistent with the existing design system, so that the user interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain the same styling as the original buttons
2. WHEN the user icon is shown THEN it SHALL be properly sized and positioned within the "My Account" button
3. WHEN buttons are in hover state THEN they SHALL maintain the existing hover effects
4. WHEN navigation is rendered THEN it SHALL be visually consistent across all affected pages
