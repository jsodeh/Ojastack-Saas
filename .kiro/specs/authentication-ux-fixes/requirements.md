# Authentication & User Experience Fixes

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical authentication and user experience issues identified during testing, including React component errors, profile data persistence, and graceful handling of optional integrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Component Rendering Errors

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to load without React errors so that I can access all features reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the dashboard THEN the page SHALL render without DialogTrigger errors
2. WHEN the mobile menu button is clicked THEN the mobile navigation SHALL open without component errors
3. WHEN any dashboard page loads THEN all Radix UI components SHALL be properly wrapped in their required providers

### Requirement 2: Complete Profile Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a new user, I want my company information and other signup details to be saved to my profile so that I don't have to re-enter them later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up with company information THEN the company name SHALL be saved to their profile
2. WHEN a user signs up with company size THEN the company size SHALL be stored in profile metadata
3. WHEN a user signs up with newsletter preference THEN the preference SHALL be recorded in their profile
4. WHEN a user's profile is created THEN all signup metadata SHALL be accessible in the dashboard

### Requirement 3: Graceful Integration Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work smoothly even when optional integrations like n8n are not available so that core functionality remains accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN n8n is not running THEN the dashboard SHALL load without connection errors
2. WHEN optional integrations fail THEN the user SHALL see appropriate fallback content instead of error messages
3. WHEN integration services are unavailable THEN core authentication and dashboard features SHALL remain functional
4. WHEN integration errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged as warnings rather than blocking errors

### Requirement 4: Email Verification Flow Completion

**User Story:** As a new user, I want a smooth email verification process so that I can quickly access my account after signup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN they SHALL receive a verification email with the correct redirect URL
2. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN they SHALL be redirected to the confirmation page
3. WHEN email verification succeeds THEN the user SHALL be automatically redirected to the dashboard
4. WHEN email verification fails THEN the user SHALL see clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 5: Dashboard Data Loading

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to see my actual profile data and usage statistics in the dashboard so that I can monitor my account status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN their real profile data SHALL be displayed instead of mock data
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN usage statistics SHALL be fetched from the database
3. WHEN profile information is missing THEN appropriate default values SHALL be shown
4. WHEN data loading fails THEN the user SHALL see loading states and error handling

### Requirement 6: Error Boundary and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully so that one component failure doesn't break the entire interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a React component error occurs THEN the error boundary SHALL catch it and display a fallback UI
2. WHEN an error is caught THEN the user SHALL see options to retry or navigate to a working page
3. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include sufficient context for debugging
4. WHEN the application recovers from an error THEN the user SHALL be able to continue their workflow
