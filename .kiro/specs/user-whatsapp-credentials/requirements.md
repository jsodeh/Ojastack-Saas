# User-Provided WhatsApp Credentials Requirements

## Introduction

This feature refactors the WhatsApp Business API integration to allow users to bring their own WhatsApp Business API credentials instead of requiring platform-level credentials. This approach provides better security, scalability, and user control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Credential Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provide my own WhatsApp Business API credentials so that I have full control over my WhatsApp integration and don't depend on platform-level credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to add WhatsApp capabilities to their agent THEN the system SHALL provide a secure form to input their WhatsApp Business API credentials
2. WHEN a user provides WhatsApp credentials THEN the system SHALL validate the credentials before storing them
3. WHEN credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them in the database
4. WHEN a user wants to update their credentials THEN the system SHALL allow credential updates with re-validation
5. WHEN a user removes WhatsApp integration THEN the system SHALL securely delete their stored credentials

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Webhook Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my WhatsApp webhooks to be automatically configured and managed so that I don't need to manually set up webhook endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds WhatsApp credentials THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a unique webhook URL for their integration
2. WHEN the webhook URL is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically configure it with the user's WhatsApp Business API
3. WHEN a webhook receives a message THEN the system SHALL route it to the correct user's agent based on the webhook URL
4. WHEN a user removes WhatsApp integration THEN the system SHALL clean up the webhook configuration

### Requirement 3: Agent-Level WhatsApp Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure WhatsApp settings per agent so that different agents can have different WhatsApp behaviors and phone numbers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing an agent THEN the system SHALL provide an option to enable WhatsApp integration
2. WHEN WhatsApp is enabled for an agent THEN the system SHALL allow selection of which WhatsApp Business phone number to use
3. WHEN an agent has WhatsApp enabled THEN the system SHALL display the agent's WhatsApp phone number and status
4. WHEN multiple agents use the same WhatsApp credentials THEN the system SHALL properly route messages based on phone number and agent configuration

### Requirement 4: Secure Credential Storage

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want user WhatsApp credentials to be stored securely so that user data is protected and compliant with security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WhatsApp credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using industry-standard encryption
2. WHEN credentials are retrieved THEN the system SHALL decrypt them only when needed for API calls
3. WHEN credentials are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL securely delete them from memory
4. WHEN accessing credentials THEN the system SHALL log access for security auditing

### Requirement 5: Credential Validation and Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want to know if my WhatsApp credentials are working correctly so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain reliable service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL validate them by making a test API call to WhatsApp
2. WHEN credentials become invalid THEN the system SHALL notify the user and disable the integration
3. WHEN WhatsApp API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and guidance
4. WHEN checking credential health THEN the system SHALL provide a status dashboard showing connection status and recent activity

### Requirement 6: Migration from Platform Credentials

**User Story:** As an existing user with platform-level WhatsApp integration, I want to migrate to my own credentials so that I can maintain continuity while gaining control over my integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new system is deployed THEN existing integrations SHALL continue to work with platform credentials
2. WHEN a user wants to migrate THEN the system SHALL provide a migration wizard to switch to user credentials
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL disable platform-level credentials for that user
4. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback to platform credentials and provide error details

### Requirement 7: No Platform Credentials Required

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to remove the requirement for platform-level WhatsApp credentials so that the platform is easier to deploy and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL NOT require WhatsApp credentials in environment variables
2. WHEN WhatsApp features are accessed without user credentials THEN the system SHALL prompt users to provide their own credentials
3. WHEN no users have WhatsApp configured THEN the system SHALL still function normally without WhatsApp features
4. WHEN deploying the platform THEN WhatsApp credentials SHALL be optional in the environment configuration
