# Visual Agent Builder Requirements

## Introduction

Transform the current static agent creation system into a dynamic, no-code visual builder that allows users to create, customize, and deploy functional AI agents through an intuitive interface. Users should be able to start with templates and fully customize them to their specific needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Template Editing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit agent templates and customize their workflows so that I can adapt pre-built templates to my specific business needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a template THEN the system SHALL load the template's workflow in a visual editor
2. WHEN a user wants to modify a workflow THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop node editing capabilities
3. WHEN a user removes a node (like HubSpot) THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust connections and suggest alternatives
4. WHEN a user adds a new node (like WhatsApp) THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options and auto-connect where possible
5. WHEN a user saves template changes THEN the system SHALL create a custom template for that user

### Requirement 2: Visual Workflow Builder

**User Story:** As a user, I want to build agent workflows visually so that I can create complex automation without coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the workflow builder THEN the system SHALL display a canvas with available nodes in a sidebar
2. WHEN a user drags a node onto the canvas THEN the system SHALL allow positioning and connection to other nodes
3. WHEN a user connects two nodes THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and show connection status
4. WHEN a user configures a node THEN the system SHALL provide context-appropriate configuration options
5. WHEN a user tests a workflow THEN the system SHALL provide real-time execution feedback and debugging

### Requirement 3: Multi-Step Persona Creation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create agent personas through guided multi-step flows so that I can define exactly how my agent behaves and responds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts persona creation THEN the system SHALL guide them through role definition, tone, expertise areas, and response patterns
2. WHEN a user defines agent behavior THEN the system SHALL provide multiple choice options for common scenarios
3. WHEN a user customizes responses THEN the system SHALL allow example input/output pairs for training
4. WHEN a user sets constraints THEN the system SHALL provide options for handling edge cases and escalation
5. WHEN persona creation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive system prompt automatically

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Channel Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily configure communication channels for my agent so that I can deploy it across multiple platforms without technical setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a channel THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step configuration guidance
2. WHEN a user configures WhatsApp THEN the system SHALL integrate with the user-provided credentials system
3. WHEN a user sets up multiple channels THEN the system SHALL allow channel-specific behavior customization
4. WHEN channels are configured THEN the system SHALL test connectivity and provide status feedback
5. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically set up webhooks and routing

### Requirement 5: Real Agent Creation and Deployment

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent creation process to actually create functional agents so that I can immediately start using them for real conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes agent setup THEN the system SHALL create a functional agent in the database
2. WHEN an agent is created THEN the system SHALL generate all necessary API endpoints and webhooks
3. WHEN an agent is deployed THEN the system SHALL activate all configured channels and integrations
4. WHEN an agent receives messages THEN the system SHALL process them according to the configured workflow
5. WHEN an agent responds THEN the system SHALL use the defined persona and follow the workflow logic

### Requirement 6: Template Marketplace and Sharing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to share my custom templates and use templates created by others so that I can benefit from community knowledge and contribute back.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a custom template THEN the system SHALL allow them to publish it to the marketplace
2. WHEN a user browses templates THEN the system SHALL show both official and community templates with ratings
3. WHEN a user imports a template THEN the system SHALL adapt it to their available integrations and credentials
4. WHEN templates are shared THEN the system SHALL include documentation and usage examples
5. WHEN users rate templates THEN the system SHALL use feedback to improve recommendations

### Requirement 7: Advanced Workflow Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create sophisticated workflows with conditional logic, loops, and integrations so that my agents can handle complex business processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs conditional logic THEN the system SHALL provide if/then/else nodes with visual condition builders
2. WHEN a user needs data processing THEN the system SHALL provide transformation nodes for common operations
3. WHEN a user needs external integrations THEN the system SHALL provide pre-built connectors for popular services
4. WHEN a user needs custom logic THEN the system SHALL allow JavaScript code nodes with syntax highlighting
5. WHEN workflows become complex THEN the system SHALL provide organization tools like groups and comments

### Requirement 8: Testing and Debugging Tools

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test my agents thoroughly before deployment so that I can ensure they work correctly in all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user tests an agent THEN the system SHALL provide a realistic chat interface for interaction
2. WHEN a user debugs workflows THEN the system SHALL show execution paths and variable values in real-time
3. WHEN a user simulates scenarios THEN the system SHALL allow predefined test cases and edge case testing
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested fixes
5. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a test report with coverage and performance metrics
