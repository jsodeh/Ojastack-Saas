# Comprehensive AI Agent Management System

## Introduction

This specification outlines the development of a comprehensive AI agent management system that allows users to create, customize, and deploy intelligent agents across multiple channels. The system integrates with n8n for workflow orchestration, supports multimodal capabilities, and provides a seamless no-code experience for agent creation and deployment.

5. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL identify file types (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, JPEG, PNG, TXT, etc.) and show appropriate icons
6. WHEN files are processed THEN the system SHALL index content for retrieval and show processing status
7. WHEN file upload fails THEN the user SHALL see clear error messages with retry options
8. WHEN files are successfully processed THEN they SHALL be available for immediate use by the agent

2. WHEN a user configures personality THEN they SHALL have multiple choice options for tone (Professional, Friendly, Casual, Formal, etc.)
3. WHEN a user sets creativity level THEN they SHALL use a slider from 0% to 100% with real-time preview
4. WHEN a user makes personality choices THEN they SHALL see a preview of how responses might sound
5. WHEN personality is configured THEN the system SHALL generate an appropriate system prompt
6. WHEN a user wants advanced options THEN they SHALL be able to edit the system prompt directly
7. WHEN template-based creation is used THEN personality fields SHALL be pre-populated with template defaults

### Requirement 5: Capabilities Selection Step

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select which modalities my agent can handle so that it can interact through the appropriate channels and methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reaches the Capabilities step THEN they SHALL see toggles for different modalities
2. WHEN a user enables Text/Chat THEN the agent SHALL use OpenAI/Anthropic APIs for text processing
3. WHEN a user enables Voice mode THEN the agent SHALL use ElevenLabs for speech synthesis and recognition
4. WHEN a user enables Image processing THEN the agent SHALL use OpenAI/Anthropic vision capabilities
5. WHEN a user enables Video calls THEN the agent SHALL use LiveKit for video conversations
6. WHEN a user enables Conversational mode THEN the agent SHALL support real-time voice interactions
7. WHEN capabilities are selected THEN the system SHALL show available tools for each modality
8. WHEN a user selects tools THEN they SHALL see descriptions and enable/disable individual tools (Web Search, Calculator, Date & Time, Weather, etc.)

### Requirement 6: Deployment Channels Step

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select where I want to deploy my agent so that it can be accessible through my preferred channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reaches the Channels step THEN they SHALL see available deployment options
2. WHEN a user selects Web Chat THEN they SHALL configure website widget settings
3. WHEN a user selects WhatsApp THEN they SHALL configure WhatsApp Business API settings
4. WHEN a user selects Email THEN they SHALL configure email integration settings
5. WHEN a user selects Slack THEN they SHALL configure Slack workspace integration
6. WHEN channels are selected THEN the system SHALL validate required configurations
7. WHEN deployment is configured THEN the user SHALL be able to proceed to testing

### Requirement 7: Agent Testing and Deployment

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test my agent before deployment and then deploy it to my selected channels so that I can ensure it works correctly.
