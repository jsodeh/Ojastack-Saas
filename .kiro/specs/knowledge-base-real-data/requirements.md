# Knowledge Base Real Data Integration

## Introduction

The Knowledge Base dashboard component currently displays hardcoded demo data including fake knowledge bases, documents, and statistics, even when users have not uploaded any actual knowledge bases. This creates a misleading user experience and prevents users from understanding the true state of their knowledge base resources. The component needs to be updated to display real-time data from the user's actual uploaded knowledge bases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real Knowledge Base Statistics

**User Story:** As a user viewing the Knowledge Base dashboard, I want to see accurate statistics about my actual knowledge bases, so that I can understand my current usage and storage consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has no knowledge bases THEN the "Total Knowledge Bases" stat SHALL show 0
2. WHEN a user has knowledge bases THEN the "Total Knowledge Bases" stat SHALL show the actual count from the database
3. WHEN a user has no documents THEN the "Total Documents" stat SHALL show 0
4. WHEN a user has documents THEN the "Total Documents" stat SHALL show the actual count across all knowledge bases
5. WHEN calculating storage used THEN it SHALL reflect the actual file sizes of uploaded documents
6. WHEN showing processing queue THEN it SHALL display the actual number of documents being processed

### Requirement 2: Real Knowledge Base Listings

**User Story:** As a user managing knowledge bases, I want to see only my actual knowledge bases with real data, so that I can effectively manage my uploaded content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has no knowledge bases THEN the knowledge base list SHALL show an empty state with guidance
2. WHEN a user has knowledge bases THEN only their actual knowledge bases SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN displaying knowledge base details THEN all information SHALL come from the database (name, status, document count, size, last updated)
4. WHEN showing knowledge base status THEN it SHALL reflect the actual processing state (active, processing, error)
5. WHEN displaying document counts THEN they SHALL be accurate counts from the database

### Requirement 3: Real Recent Documents

**User Story:** As a user tracking document uploads, I want to see my actual recently uploaded documents, so that I can monitor the processing status of my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has no documents THEN the Recent Documents section SHALL show an empty state
2. WHEN a user has uploaded documents THEN only their actual documents SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN showing document details THEN all information SHALL be real (filename, size, upload date, chunk count, processing status)
4. WHEN displaying processing status THEN it SHALL reflect the actual state from the database
5. WHEN showing file sizes THEN they SHALL be the actual file sizes, not demo data

### Requirement 4: Empty State Handling

**User Story:** As a new user with no knowledge bases, I want to see helpful empty states that guide me on how to get started, so that I understand what actions to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying empty states THEN they SHALL include clear messaging about the current state
2. WHEN showing empty states THEN they SHALL provide actionable guidance for next steps
3. WHEN a user sees empty states THEN they SHALL include buttons or links to relevant actions
4. WHEN transitioning from empty to populated states THEN the UI SHALL update smoothly

### Requirement 5: Real-time Data Updates

**User Story:** As a user uploading and managing documents, I want the dashboard to reflect changes in real-time, so that I can see the current state of my knowledge bases without refreshing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the statistics SHALL update to reflect new data
2. WHEN processing completes THEN the status indicators SHALL update automatically
3. WHEN knowledge bases are created or deleted THEN the listings SHALL update accordingly
4. WHEN data is loading THEN appropriate loading states SHALL be shown
5. WHEN errors occur THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed with recovery options
